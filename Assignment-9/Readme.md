The first version of the code has a more human touch—the docstrings feel thoughtful and descriptive, guiding the reader through the logic in a friendly, easy-to-follow way. It explains the steps and the reasoning behind them, making the code feel more approachable. The second version, however, reflects an AI-generated style. It’s clean, structured, and straight to the point, but also more generic. It focuses on what the function does without offering additional context. In short, the manual docstrings feel more personal and clear, while the AI-generated ones are efficient but more rigid. This helps us see that AI can produce good documentation quickly, but human-written explanations often communicate ideas more naturally.

In the next comparison, the manually written comments stand out because they are purposeful and selective. They highlight only the important parts of the class or method, explaining the intention behind certain decisions without stating the obvious. The AI-style comments, on the other hand, tend to annotate almost every line, often repeating what the code clearly shows. While detailed, they can feel mechanical and unnecessary. As a result, the manual comments convey meaning and reasoning better, while AI-generated comments are more literal and exhaustive. This contrast helps students understand that AI can generate plenty of comments fast, but meaningful documentation still benefits from thoughtful human judgment.

Finally, for the NumPy-style docstrings, the manually written version has a friendly, conversational tone. It explains what each function does and also provides small hints that help beginners understand the logic. The AI-generated docstrings follow the NumPy format very strictly, using short and uniform wording. They are precise and clean but offer little extra explanation. Because of this, the manual docstrings feel more relatable and easier to understand, while the AI ones are consistent but lack personalization. Together, these differences show students how AI can be helpful for structured documentation, but human-written docstrings can make the material clearer and more engaging.
